# leetcode repo

## this structure of this repository:

the dir name is equal with the tag in leetcode, such as the tag of minimum spanning tree is disjoint set, we move it into the disjoint directory.

the language used is c or js or python etc... i think classify it with different branch is better

the interpreter to execute js is node, compiler of c is clang14, python is python3.9
